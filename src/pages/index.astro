// With the new dashboard concept, we remove the Layout wrapper padding or manage it differently?
// Actually, Layout provides Header/Footer. The new Dashboard design has its own Sidebar/Header flow.
// If we use Layout, we get double headers.
// We should probably create a new Layout for the Dashboard or simply NOT use the main Layout for the index page if index IS the dashboard which contains everything.
// HOWEVER: The requested design implies a persistent Sidebar.
// Let's use a "clean" Layout or just generic HTML structure here if we want to override the default Header.
// BUT: The user might want the main Header to stay for "Compare / Prompts" links.
// Let's try to fit the Dashboard INTO the existing Layout first. If it looks double-headed, we can toggle the Header off.
// Given the mockup description "Sidebar (Filters) ... Header Compacto", it implies the Dashboard HAS its own header structure.
// Let's assume for now we want to keep the Global Header for top-level site nav, and the Dashboard is the "App" inside.
// OR: The Dashboard IS the site.
// Let's stick to the Plan: "Layout > IAHub".
// To avoid double scrolling, we might need adjustments, but let's ship the component integration first.
